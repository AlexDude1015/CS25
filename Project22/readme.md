### Class Activity 22

---

My program extracts the first and last name from a string, and 
stores them into individual string variables. 

I made some slight adjustments to test it. The program will ask users to enter
their whole name. A blank character will be identified, and whatever comes before it
will be the first name, whatever follows will be the last name.
