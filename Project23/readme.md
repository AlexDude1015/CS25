Class Activity 23

---

This program validates a customer's number. 
When users enter their number, the program checks for the following:

1) The input has six characters.
2) The first two characters are alphabetical.
3) The last four characters are digits.

If the user input is invalid, the program will print, "Invalid input," and 
explain why it is so.
