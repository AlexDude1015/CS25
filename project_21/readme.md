### Project 21 by Alexander Li

---

Utilize smart pointers for dynamic memory allocation of an array, and write functions to fill and print the arrayâ€™s sum numbers.

This project was submitted late for the following reasons:

1) I had to migrate my work from Vscode to Clion. At first, I switched to xcode, but I didn't like it.
2) I learned how to create a gitignore and MIT License for my repository.
3) I learned how to push my code through terminal on mac, because it gave me more control.

I hope you can excuse my tardiness this once for the adjustment.
